# People-Search-OSINT
<p>UK People search sites that are free, are few in number, generally becuase of GDPR. It is a lucrative business, Pipl is a prime example of a free service that as it gained in popularity, moved to a paid service. I have tried to only include free resourse or resource that will give a certain amount of information for free. A lot services are mainly US orientated because of the slack privacy laws in the US. This could change in the future as more States bring in GDPR like legislation.</p>
